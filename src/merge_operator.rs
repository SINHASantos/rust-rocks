// The Merge Operator
//
// Essentially, a MergeOperator specifies the SEMANTICS of a merge, which only
// client knows. It could be numeric addition, list append, string
// concatenation, edit data structure, ... , anything.
// The library, on the other hand, is concerned with the exercise of this
// interface, at the right time (during get, iteration, compaction...)
//
// To use merge, the client needs to provide an object implementing one of
// the following interfaces:
//  a) AssociativeMergeOperator - for most simple semantics (always take
//    two values, and merge them into one value, which is then put back
//    into rocksdb); numeric addition and string concatenation are examples;
//
//  b) MergeOperator - the generic class for all the more abstract / complex
//    operations; one method (FullMergeV2) to merge a Put/Delete value with a
//    merge operand; and another method (PartialMerge) that merges multiple
//    operands together. this is especially useful if your key values have
//    complex structures but you would still like to support client-specific
//    incremental updates.
//
// AssociativeMergeOperator is simpler to implement. MergeOperator is simply
// more powerful.
//
// Refer to rocksdb-merge wiki for more details and example implementations.
